# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: tc

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder. An argument is a parameter that is used within a function. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder with no value, but is apart of the function definition. An argument is a (parameter with a value) value that gets passed through when invocation happens. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() takes in three prefined parameters. Value, index, and i believe element are its predefined parameters.

Researched answer: The built in method .map()'s three predefined parameters are (current)value, index, and array. The current value is the only required parameters for functions but index and array can also be used but are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map is used to create a brand new array of all the changed values. Filter, filters through an array to create an array with only the specifically changed values.

Researched answer: The map method transforms the elements of an array and creates a new array for the transformed values. The filter method selects elements from an array and makes a new array(subset array) for the elements that satisfy the condition given.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the repeating of an action, done until the condition is met. Iteration will stop once the condition either becomes false or meets the wanted condition. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of a block of code being executed over and over until a condition is met. Iteration is used mostly with strings and arrays because they have length properties. For loops are how iteration is executed.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a set of detailed instructions, meant to be followed through. A function is a block of reusable code that preforms a specific task. A method is a predetermined function that belongs to a specific object.

Researched answer: A function is a reusable block of code that will only run if invoked and always return an output. A method is a property that contains a function definition to preform an action on an object. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Moves the declaration to the top of the scope you are in (var). var can be used anywhere in the code as long as it gets declared at some point. Const and let cannout be used anywhere in the code, before it is declared. Hoisting only works for var.

Researched answer: Hoisting can be used on const, let, and var but const and let are hoisted without default initialization so they are put in a dead zone because they are inaccessible if they havent been declared unlike var. var is hoisted with a undefined default initialization without needing to be declared. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: uses (...) to easily copy all or parts of an existing array or object and place it inside another array or object.

2. React state: The react state is an object where you store the property values that belong to the component. React components almost always have a built in state object.

3. DOM events: Document Object Model events, are signals that alert that something is occurring either in browser or by a users interaction.
